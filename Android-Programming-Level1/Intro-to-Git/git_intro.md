[Basic Git commands](https://github.com/JonathanMoreno14/RubyonRails-CommandLine-Syntax/blob/master/RubyonRails-Topics/Git-Basic-Commands.md)


When searching a file directory you must use the **cd** then type the directory or file you are looking for

####Example

We are looking for the *index_file* folder on our desktop

To search for that specific folder we will use the *Git Bash terminal*

*cd Desktop*  - Here we are choosing to search the folder in the Desktop location

*cd index_file* - Once we find the folder we are looking for we use *CD FolderName*

Now we are inside the folder were the file is located from here we are going to initialize a repository for this file using **git init**

Once the repository has been initialized he had the file to the repository using **git add -A** this command will add the file into the repository

Lastly you commit the changes that have been made what so ever using this command **git commit -m "Some message"**
